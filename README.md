# EF Core Learning & Tasks 

Welcome to this repository! 
This space is dedicated to documenting my learning journey in **Entity Framework Core**. Here, I upload practical applications, coding challenges, and solutions related to database management using C# and .NET.

## Repository Goals
- Apply theoretical concepts through **hands-on practice**.
- Document coding challenges and their solutions.
- Build a personal reference for code snippets and best practices.

## Topics Covered
This repository contains tasks covering the following concepts:
* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
* **Data Modeling:** Defining entities and handling relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
* **Fluent API:** Advanced model configuration and constraints.
* **LINQ Queries:** Writing efficient queries and filtering data.
* **Migrations:** Managing database schema changes (Code-First approach).
* **Performance:** Query optimization and handling the N+1 problem.
* **Architecture:** Implementing patterns like Repository and Unit of Work (if applicable).

## Tech Stack
